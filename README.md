2025-09-19. Some time ago, the backend canister stopped working because its cycles balance ran low. I topped it up, and it is now functioning normally. If the app stops working again, the issue may be due to a low cycles balance on either the backend or the frontend canister. In that case, please top up the corresponding canister:
* Backend canister: 4u67j-raaaa-aaaal-qb4bq-cai
* Frontend canister: 4bzoe-qiaaa-aaaal-qb4ca-cai
